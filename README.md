This is the ReadMe file for my github repository where I upload my weekly Assignments fo the Python for Data Science Course.

# Week 1: 
  Python_Excerise_1.ipynb
# Week 2:
  PythonExcercise2.ipynb
# Week 3:
  session_3_exercises.ipynb
  ## Structure:
    - The file first contains some examples regarding Object Orientiated Programming (OOP) which was disussed during the lecture.
    - In the second half of the file, there are some Hands on Excercises and Homework which ount as the weekly exercises for our Python course.
    - The following excersices regading OOP were done as homework:
    1. Create a Course class, where each course has a name, a description and a list of enrolled students. You'll need to implement the next methods:
          Add a student to the course.
          Remove a student from the course.
          Show all students in the course.
    2. Create a Student class, where each student has a name, ID number, address and a list of enrolled courses with the following methods:
          Enroll in a course.
          Drop a course.
          Show all registered student courses.
    3. Create a central class that manages courses and students, Registration class, where you have a list of students and a list of courses, and methods:
          Enroll in a course.
          Drop a course.
          Show all the enrolled courses.
